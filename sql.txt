SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT od.OrderID AS "ID", pro.ProductName AS "Product Name", 
	od.Quantity AS "Quantity" 
    FROM OrderDetails AS "od"
	INNER JOIN Products AS "pro"
    ON od.productID = pro.productID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
	od.ProductID AS ProductID,
    od.Quantity AS Quantity 
    FROM Orders AS o
	INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od 
    ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    INNER JOIN Employees AS e 
    ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID;
