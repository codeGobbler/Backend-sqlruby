SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT det.OrderID AS "ID", pro.ProductName AS "Product Name", det.Quantity AS "Quantity" FROM OrderDetails AS "det"
	INNER JOIN Products AS "pro";

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName AS "EmployeeName", ode.ProductID AS "Product ID", ode.Quantity AS "Quantity" FROM Orders AS "ord"
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS "ode"
    INNER JOIN Employees AS "emp";
